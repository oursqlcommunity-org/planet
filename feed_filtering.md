At the inception of Planet for the MySQL Community, no feed filtering was implemented.
At the time, it was thought that it would be possible to keep a signal-to-noise ratio
about MySQL and Variants content by using tagged feed.  This had limited success
([Percona](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/6) and
[Isotopp](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/48)),
lead to noise and missing posts
([Mydbaops](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/70) and
[Percona](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/68)),
and to the non-aggregation of some blogs 
([GitHub](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/7),
[Phpflow](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/9) and 
[Geeksww](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/issues/66)).
Only relying on tagged feed turned out to be non-satisfactory and it became clear that
implementing some sort of filtering was needed.

Implementing filtering was delayed as it was considered to be a non-trivial
change to
[index.html.erb](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/blob/master/template/index.html.erb)
and [atom.xml.erb](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/blob/master/template/atom.xml.erb).
If someone wants to take a shot at this, pull request would be considered,
but maybe create an issue first to avoid wasting time and effort.

Filtering was finally enabled by using an external service:
[rss.app](https://rss.app/).  Some examples of filtered feeds are 
[Mydbaops](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/commit/79362749ad88b1f00fc9c3398d4ded0f36b2aac9)
and [Percona](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/commit/7b6e80760854e27c4d6746c495433713ea8c0a94),
and there are others.

Filtering with rss.app is considered an experiment for now.  It currently
leads to good results, but its subscription-based model makes it something
that we might want to replace, especially when we need more
than 15 filtered feeds and have to upgrade from the [Basic to the Developper
subscription](https://rss.app/plans).
