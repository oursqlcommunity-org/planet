# Inception

Planet for the MySQL Community is a project initiated by Jean-François Gagné.  It aims at
making a blog aggregator for the MySQL Community/Ecosystem.  The state of the previous aggregator,
Planet MySQL, is considered [unhealthy](https://jfg-mysql.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-state-of-planet-mysql-unhealty.html)
for the Ecosystem, hence the need for a new one.

# Help

This project is the result of many discussions with different people, including in the
[mysqlcommunity_org](https://app.slack.com/client/T8R1330CR/C0129P0K42J) channel
in the [MySQL Community](https://lefred.be/mysql-community-on-slack/) Slack.  It would
not be possible to acknowledge all contributors to these but I will mention a few.

Thanks to Shlomi Noach for having initiated the revolution that led to the creation
of Planet for the MySQL Community by publishing the blog post
[Pulling this blog out of Planet MySQL aggregator, over community concerns](http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/pulling-this-blog-out-of-planet-mysql-aggregator-over-community-concerns).

The list of [contributors](https://github.com/oursqlcommunity-org/planet/graphs/contributors)

## Sysadmin help

Maintaining a blog aggregator is not a lot of work, but it should not be on a single
person.  In addition to Jean-François Gagné, the following people have commit access to
the repository and are able to make change to the website:

* [Ivan Groenewold](https://github.com/igroene)
* [Simon J Mudd](https://github.com/sjmudd)
